Service Exchange is a really simple app that lets you connect with people around you and exchange various services. <br/>For free. <br/>Simply type in the service you need (e.g. A painting job, logo design, tax filling, etc.), browse for users who offer it and propose an exchange. If they accept, you have a deal.<br /> Finally, don't forget to rate users to help the community grow and get better.
